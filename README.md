# from-EDA-to-Prediction
Black Friday Purchase Prediction using EDA, feature engineering, and multiple regressors. XGBoost delivered the best accuracy for predicting purchase amount.


### 🛍️ Black Friday Purchase Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict customer purchase amounts using the **Black Friday dataset**. The workflow includes:

- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data distribution, relationships, and patterns.
- 🧪 **Feature Engineering** to transform raw data into meaningful features.
- ⚙️ **Model Training and Evaluation** using multiple regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  

After experimenting with various models, **XGBoost Regressor** achieved the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
